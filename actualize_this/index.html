      <p style="text-align: right;">The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing. It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw - not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.</p>

      <p style="padding-top: 20px; text-align: left; line-height: 2">Charlotte Perkins Gilman (/ˈɡɪlmən/; née Perkins; July 3, 1860 – August 17, 1935), also known as Charlotte Perkins Stetson, her first married name, was a prominent American humanist, novelist, writer of short stories, poetry and nonfiction, and a lecturer for social reform . . .<br><em>from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Perkins_Gilman">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

    <h2>“Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be.”</h2>
    <h3>You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was.</h3>
    <p>Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind,<br>and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over. <br>But nobody could climb through that pattern--it strangles so; <br>I think that is why it has so many heads.</p>
