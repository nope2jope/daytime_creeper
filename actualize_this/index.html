    <h3>The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.</h3>
    <p>It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw - not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.</p>

    <h3>If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one to do?</h3>
